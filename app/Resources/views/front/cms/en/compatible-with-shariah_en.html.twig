            <div class="contents-cms ">
                The card as mentioned in the question is allowed, as no sharia' violation will result from using it, thus it is Halal as God Almighty said," Allah make sale Halal"

                Although the card is not free of little of ignorance exploitation and endangering because card issuer and Success partners do not know precisely upon issuing the card to the customer the amount of deduction and incentives that they provide to him, but this is forgiven and do not affect the correctness of the contract, for two reasons:

                First: issuing the card and dealing with it do not result in damage to any of the three parties (the issuer and Success partners and the customer who is the card holder), in fact whenever the customer's use of the card increase, the benefits for all of them will increase, this is different from prohibited ignorance contracts that necessitates the loss of the other upon the profit of the other party, the much be the profit of the first the same will be the loss of the second.

                ULAMA stipulated that the prohibited exploitation of ignorance in contracts is the one that results in damage to one of the parties, Ibn Temeya said: "the sale that exploits ignorance is prohibited because of the risk that harm one of them". If there is no harm to all of them then the contracts is permissible. The second: that the card is issued free without return, and the prohibited exploitation of ignorance is that in the contracts of compensation.

                Thus the condition for the card to be allowed is that interning IKTISSAB program should not be based on fees paid by the customer the holder of the card wither such fees are upon issuance or included in the prices of commodities and services.
            </div>

            <div class="title-contents">REGARDING THE FEES PAID BY SUCCESS PARTNERS TO THE ISSUER IT IS DETAILED AS FOLLOWS:</div>
            <div class="contents-cms ">
                1- If they are percentage related to the deals made through him, e.g. bare 2 % of the total of the customer's balance or his purchases from him, this is allowed, because it is the marketing fee, and it is a sort of brokerage and the ULAMA stipulated that it is allowed even it is a percentage of the price. Al- Taswlee said: of this sort &ndash; if you said do work in my animal and you can take half of the gainâ€¦ thus the fee for the broker is said to be one quarter of the tenth) ALBAHGA book &ndash; 2/ 299.
                <br>
                Ibn Qudama said: (he may hire a brokerageâ€¦ if he specified the work without specifying the time and made for him one Dirham out of each one thousand Dirham then it is allowed). AL-moghny book 8/42.
                <br>
                2- If they are lump sum amounts paid by the partner to the issuer monthly or annually, this is not allowed unless it is for certain known work, such as to bare part of the administrative expenses such as commercial announcements, then it is allowed provided that they are the same amount of the actual costs of that work. But if in calculating such fees it is planned to cover the value of the process and incentives given to the customers then it is prohibited, as it include exploitation of ignorance. If the issuer takes form the partner a mortgage to insure the electronic devise on condition that the complete mortgage will be returned in
                case it is returned in good condition- this is not of that sort.

                Reply: Shiek: Dr. Mohammed bin Saud AL-osaimy. Thanks to god and peace and blessings be upon the profit:
                <br><br>
                I reviewed a detailed report submitted by Al-AWAEL center for economic consultations for Abdullah Salih Al- Othaim Company, the study included issuing prospectus, company articles of association, articles of incorporation, finance contracts, bank facility agreement, supply contracts, Iktissab card contract, insurance contract, and company financial lists ended at the end of 2006.
                <br><br>
                Then I reviewed an updated report about company status, and also before subscription, the two reports showed that company works are conforming to Sharia and thus subscription is allowed.
